[Ray](https://myray.app) is a wonderful desktop application that can help you debug applications faster. It can beautifully show you all debugging information, can pause your code, measure performance and [a whole lot more](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project).

To send debugging information to Ray, you can use the `ray()` function. 

By installing `spatie/global-ray`, you can use `ray()` and [all framework agnostic Ray functions](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project) in any PHP app or script on your system. 

If you installed a specific Ray package, such as [spatie/laravel-ray](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/laravel) in your project already, then `ray()` will execute that specific version, so you can use still use framework specific things such as `ray()->showQueries()` to show all executed queries.

❤️ As a bonus the popular `dd` and  `dump` functions will be made available globally too.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the global Ray via composer:

```bash
composer global require spatie/global-ray
global-ray install
```

When running `global-ray install`, we'll add a line in your `php.ini` to automatically load the functions provided by this package.

## Usage

You can use `ray()` and [all Ray's framework agnostic functions](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project) in any PHP file.

The `rd()`, `dump()` and `dd()` will also be available in any PHP project or script.

### Using framework specific functionality

To use framework specific functionality, such as [viewing queries in Laravel](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/laravel#showing-queries), or [displaying mails in WordPress](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/wordpress#displaying-mails), you should still [install the relevant package or library](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/installation-in-your-project/introduction).

If a framework specific package is detected, it will be used instead of the global Ray.

## How to uninstall

To uninstall you must first issue this command:

```bash
global-ray uninstall
```

This will remove the line in `php.ini` that automatically loads ray.

After that, you can install the package itself using

```bash
composer global remove spatie/global-ray
```


## Troubleshooting

If suddenly all of PHP scripts terminate very early with a strange error after upgrading PHP or switching to another version, then global ray might be the culprit. 

As mentioned before, during install we slightly modify your `php.ini`. To manually uninstall global ray, remove the script named `global-ray-loader.php` in the `auto_prepend_file` directive in `php.ini`. 

You find the location of your `php.ini` by executing this command:

```php
php --ini
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
